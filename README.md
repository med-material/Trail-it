Trail it (TrailiT) is a game which trains your eye sight and concentration 
ability. In the game you connect circles in the order 1-2-3-4 or in 
the order 1-A-2-B. The numbers are distributed randomly on the screen 
and your goal is to perform visual search to connect them.
Trail it is a digitalization of the Trail Making Test, which 
is a neuropsychological test used to measure and train visual neglect. 
Trail it takes measurements of your reaction time in reaching circles on 
the right and left side of the screen for you to compare. It is recomended 
to play this game on iPad. The game is developed by students at Aalborg 
University who is researching digital apps for use in rehabilitation and 
at home.
